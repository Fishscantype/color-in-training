# JS Frameworks

Tip: `8`

Prerequisites: Node.js

## Brief

The ecosystem of web development is fast, and Front-End Frameworks are all the fad. There are [many](https://github.com/collections/front-end-javascript-frameworks) front end frameworks, but my favourites are React and Vue.

## Directions

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.md`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

In that file will be a link to a repo.

This repo will be an app with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/) and*:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) *(If you don't like Pug, check out [HAML](http://haml.info/), [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [SLIM](http://slim-lang.com/), [Macdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/macdom), or just HTML)*
- [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) or [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Good Documentation**
- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) Unit Testing w/ [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (or more)
- ðŸŽ‰ Much, Much More

This will be a large part of success. A maximum of 10 extra credit points can be earned, depending on your app.

Your app will need to have a *beautiful* git tree. (Please adhere either to the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).)
