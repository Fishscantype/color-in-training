# About **ME**
## My *online* name is **mariobrostech**
## My *real* name is **AJ Ingrassia**
#### Here are some reasons why you should care about me:

1. I like to learn.
2. I am very **teamworky** *(yes, I just made up that word - deal with it)*.
3. I am very fun and like to joke around *(probably more than I should)*.
4. **I care about you :)**

#### I am an unordered list:
* I don't know what to say
* I almost forgot what an unordered list was ~~until I actually used my brain to look on the cheatsheet~~

`I like to code.`

`Coding is fun!`

*`But only when it works...`*

```
I am a code block!
```
```
I would never use this outside of Slack, but it exists in Markdown (for whatever reason...)
```

> ## ~~This is so fun...~~
