# Why Fishes can type
*My ability to type* is caused by **BIG HUGE CATERPILLARS**. Some ~~idiotic~~ *interesting* people think **BIG HUGE CATERPILLARS** are scary, but *why*? What did the **BIG HUGE CATERPILLARS** do to them?

### Why people think **BIG HUGE CATERPILLARS** are scary

I think the reason people think **BIG HUGE CATERPILLARS** are scary is because:
* their appearance
* they are bugs
* they can infest things

All of these are good reasons, but I still like them. If I haven't convinced you yet, go read [this](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-get-over-my-irrational-fear-of-caterpillars).

### Don't hate on the **BIG HUGE CATERPILLARS**

1. `They are cool`
2. `They give me my super powers`
3. `Did I already say that they are cool?`

### If they are to big, run

>Once I saw a giant caterpillar.

>It was 40 *feet* tall

>I ~~did~~ didn't know what to do.

>I started to whimper,

>then in my panic I ran into a wall

The lesson from this small poem I wrote is to watch out for walls.
