## Brief

This will test your ability to problem-solve and read documentation. This is one of the most real-world problems you will encounter.

**THIS PROJECT IS A DIFFICULT ONE. THIS IS A REMINDER THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS IN ORDER**

## Directions

You will research one of the following technologies thoroughly and create a project based on what you choose.

You will make a repository and a file called `YOUR-NAME.md`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

In the file, link to your repository

- [Notification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification) + [Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) *(-1 tip)*
  - A game using Cookies and Notifications to notify and save data.
- [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker) + [WebSockets](https://socket.io/) + [Clauneck](https://preview.npmjs.com/package/clauneck) ([CDN](https://bundle.run/clauneck@0.0.9))
  - A messaging app that uses Clauneck to store data and Workers to communicate
- [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) + [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)
  - Make an app that uses SpeechRecognition and TensorFlow.js to blow people's minds.

Whatever you choose, put the files in a `YOUR_NAME/` directory, where `YOUR_NAME` is your name.
