# Final Assignment

Tips: `10-30`

Prerequisites: None (I recommend starting when you feel ready!)

## Brief

This is your **final** assignment!

There are **no rules** and **no necessary utilities**.

You just need to work in teams and adhere to the [Color guidelines](https://aeioio.github.io/).

## Directions

You should find your teammates and create some slack channels for your project.

This can be potentially a 1+ month long project, **I EXPECT PROFESSIONAL LEVEL WORK**.

The end result should be an app hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (or something else, it simply needs to be deployed somewhere).

I **will** be looking and contributing to the projects. The more pull requests I create and you merge, the more tips. The same for issues.

I lied, there is a rule: **Have Fun**!

**Congrats on making it this far! ðŸ˜ƒ**
