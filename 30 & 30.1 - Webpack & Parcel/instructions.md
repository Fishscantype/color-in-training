# 30 & 30.1: Webpack & Parcel

Tips: `4`

Prerequisites: `#3`, `#4`, `#5`

## Brief

The web is a fast-paced and constantly evolving place. Browsers can't always keep up, and support for some technologies need to be first transformed to the basic W3.

We use bundlers to bundle different technologies and more into web-safe bundles.

## Directions

You will make a folder called `YOUR-NAME`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

You will use either Webpack or Parcel to compile your project from **#3**, **#4** and **#5**.

You will convert the HTML to Pug *(Or any other HTML Preprocessor, see #40 - Vue & React)*, CSS to Stylus *(see #40 - Vue & React)*, and (optionally) JS to TS.
