# 36 & 36.5: CircleCI & TravisCI

Tips: `3`

## Brief

Code can break, and that's a HUGE problem when uploading to production. Unit Testing and Continuous Integration fixes this by testing code before deploying.

## Directions

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.md`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

In that file will be a link to a repo with integrated [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) or [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).

The repo could be whatever you'd like, as long as it's testable.
