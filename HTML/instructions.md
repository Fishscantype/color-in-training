# HTML

Tips: `1.5`

Prerequisites: MarkDown

## Brief

HTML is the basic code for the web. It's the structure behind websites, and is used to build their contents.

## Directions

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.html`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

You will convert your MarkDown file from `#2` to HTML code.

It will require at least:

- 1 Form
  - 7 Different Inputs
- A Title
- A Header*
- A Footer*
- 2 Comments
- Classes to group sections

***Not necessarily as elements, but as parts of the page**

****Make sure to include a doctype**
