# 4: CSS

Tips: `1.25`

Prerequisites: `#3`

## Brief

While HTML is the skeleton of the page, CSS is the skin, and adds styling to the page.

## Directions

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.css`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

You will be styling your HTML page from **#3**.

You must include at least the following:

- 2 Background Colors
- 4 Text Colors
- 2 Different Fonts
- 2 Different Borders
- 1 `::after`
- 3 Font Size Changes
- 2 Margin Changes
- 1 Absolute Positioned Element
- 4 Styling Differences upon Hovering

**I'm not grading based on appeal, so don't be afraid to submit!**
