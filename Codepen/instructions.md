# Codepen

Tips: `0.8`

Prerequisites: HTML, CSS, JS

## Brief

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/) is a great way to create and share a basic webpage.

## Directions

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.md`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

In that file you will make a link to a Codepen pen with the code from **#3**, **#4** and **#5**, if applicable.

If you didn't make `#5` based on `#3`, add some quick JavaScript to the pen.
