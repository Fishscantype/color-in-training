# 5: JS

Tips: `2`

Prerequisites: `#3` (Only for option 1)

## Brief

While HTML is the webpage's bones and CSS is the skin, JavaScript is the brain, muscles and nerves. It adds functionality to the page.

## Directions

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.js`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

You have 2 options for this project:

1. Add Functionality to **#3** and **#4**
2. Make an idle game\* *(+0.5 tips)*

They must have at least the following:

- 1 Alert
- 1 Prompt
- 1 Log to the console
- 4 Functions
- 1 Class
- 5 Promises**
- 3 Event Listeners

***Base this game on the following HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title id="title">Game</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
