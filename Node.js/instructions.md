# Node.js

Tips: `3`

Prerequisites: JS

This assignment reviews your Node.js knowledge!

You will make a repository and a file called `YOUR-NAME.md`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

In this, link to your repository.

## Option 1

This will be an open project. Find at least 3 packages and make something of it.

**THIS IS ONE OF THE TIMES TO PUT MORE ELBOW GREASE THAN THE REST TO GAIN EXTRA TIPS**

## Option 2 *(+10 tips)*

You can make a Nodebot using [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/).

You will show it to me in person, with the code hosted on GitHub, in a new Repository.

I'm expecting something worth the 10 extra tips, so make it **cool**.
